## Full Description (4000 characters max)
Learn Vietnamese tones the natural way - by listening!

Vietnamese Tone Trainer helps you master the six Vietnamese tones through focused listening practice. Unlike traditional apps that rely on reading and translation, we use an audio-first approach that trains your ear to recognize and distinguish tones naturally.

**Key Features:**

🎧 **Audio-First Learning**
Listen to native Vietnamese pronunciation and learn to recognize words by their sound, not just their spelling. High-quality text-to-speech helps you hear the subtle differences between tones.

🧠 **Smart Spaced Repetition**
Our FSRS (Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler) algorithm tracks your progress and schedules reviews at optimal intervals. Words you struggle with appear more often, while mastered words are reviewed less frequently.

🖼️ **Visual Learning**
Associate Vietnamese words with images rather than English translations. This builds direct connections between sounds and meanings, bypassing your native language for faster fluency.

📊 **Progress Tracking**
Track your learning journey with detailed statistics. See how many words you've mastered, your accuracy rates, and daily practice streaks.

☁️ **Cloud Sync**
Create an account to sync your progress across devices. Start practicing on your phone and continue on your tablet without losing progress.

🌐 **Works Offline**
Audio files are embedded in the app, so you can practice anywhere without an internet connection.

**Why Focus on Tones?**

Vietnamese is a tonal language where the same syllable can have six different meanings depending on its tone. Many learners struggle because they try to learn vocabulary without first training their ears to hear tonal differences.

Vietnamese Tone Trainer takes a different approach: master the tones first, and vocabulary acquisition becomes much easier.

**Perfect for:**
- Beginners starting their Vietnamese journey
- Intermediate learners wanting to improve pronunciation
- Anyone struggling to distinguish Vietnamese tones
- Travelers preparing for a trip to Vietnam

Start your Vietnamese learning journey today with Vietnamese Tone Trainer!
