# Language app

## Core ideas

- Focus on listening/speaking/visual as much as possible, not on text
- Use text corpus to find out what are the most relevent words/n-grams
- Keep a machine learning model that tracks how well a user knows specific words/how saturated the learning is
- Repeat words/n-grams that are common and have a potential for learining


# Core technologies

- Rect frontend, with focus on using modern react libraries
- Python backend with fastapi+sqlmodel+sqlite
- Machine learning with pytorch lightning

# Languages

- Focus on vietnamese for now, norwegian and spanish later

# Corpuses

- Use the lyrics of spotify playlists as the text corpus, maybe also newspapers and transcribed podcasts and tv-shows

# Drills

- Play word, and user chooses picture
- Show picture, and user chooses/pronounces word (button to show written word in english)


Word is used interchangably with n-grams
